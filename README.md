## IoTpractice
The practice project for IoT consulting team. Builds on Augur's decentralized prediction market platform, switching human oracles out for sensors.

# Need to do
* Create a wrapper for Augurâ€™s source code
  * Possibly a modified version of the augur.js wrapper
* Switch the oracle interaction within the source code to sensor data input for the purpose of executing smart contracts 
  * 
* Create an API so that sensors can connect and interact with the smart contracts created within Augur
  *
